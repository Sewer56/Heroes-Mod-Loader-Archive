# Short Description of this Repository

The descriptions are unaltered, as originally written within their respective Github repositories.
Uploaded merely for the sake of nostalgia; and perhaps educational purposes.

The files of each repository are not altered either, thus would require fixing in order to compile; this procedure will typically involve copying libSonicHeroes and adding it as project reference.

### Heroes-Mod-Loader

The one universal Mod Loader, designed to function and act as the main mod loader for the less popular of the games, initially named after its first target, Sonic Heroes.

### Heroes-Mod-Loader-DLL-Template

General template for creation of Mod Loader mods. Starts you off with everything you need to use any feature of the mod loader, can be stripped down to user's specific needs.

### libSonicHeroes

The main development library of Heroes Mod Loader modifications.

**NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO COPY THIS TO OTHER PROJECTS TO COMPILE PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING HERE.**

### Heroes-Tweakbox

The Heroes Mod Loader Tech Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O3IDXzU5L8

### Analog-Overwrite

Overrides the current controller's analog inputs to the controller assigned as Slot/Controller ID 1. This is a potential fix for spinning cameras on obscure controllers as well as providing support for camera rotation with triggers.

### D2D-Sample

A more advanced example for the Direct2D drawing tutorial, presents an ingame overlay when the character is within a stage showcasing the character's position and velocity. Functions only in borderless or windowed mode.

### Magnetic-Barrier-Sample

This mod loader sample for Sonic Heroes provides a magnetic barrier implementation which sucks in rings towards the current leader.

### Riders-BoostTweaks

A basic mod for Sonic Riders which runs on the Heroes Mod Loader: Additively makes boost pads increase your speed by 10% (even when boosting) and removes friction.

### Riders-FootRace

The most basic of mods for Sonic Riders: Forces a foot race upon all players, inclusive of the AI.

### Riders-SlideRace

This is silly. Merely overrides the physics value for the braking speed, allowing you to go faster by trying to slow down... oh dear.
